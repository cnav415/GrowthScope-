# GrowthScope-
Interactive dashboard built with Python and Streamlit to visualize social media growth across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Spotify. Features dynamic filtering, custom date ranges, and real-time data insights for creators and analysts.

🧠 Why I Built It

I built GrowthScope to combine my passion for technology, data, and design — and to create a tool that helps others. While working in wireless testing and customer experience roles at Apple, I saw how powerful clear, actionable data can be in driving decisions and solving problems.

I wanted to apply those lessons to the creative world — giving artists, marketers, and content creators a way to easily track and understand their growth across platforms. Most tools out there are either expensive or overly complex, so I challenged myself to build something simple, effective, and free to use.

This project also helped me level up my skills in Python, data visualization, and building intuitive user experiences — and it reflects my goal of transitioning into data analytics or engineering roles where I can create meaningful, user-focused solutions.
